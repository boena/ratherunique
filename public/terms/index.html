      <h1 class="text-3xl mb-4">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p class="my-4">
      By downloading or using the game, these terms will
      automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
      that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re
      not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game,
      or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
      to extract the source code of the game, and you also
      shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or
      make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trade
      marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
      property rights related to it, still belong to
      Rather Unique AB.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      The game stores and processes personal data
      that you have provided to us, in order to provide
      our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
      phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
      that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
      process of removing software restrictions and limitations
      imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
      could make your phone vulnerable to
      malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
      security features and it could mean that the
      game won’t work properly or at all.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      You should be aware that there are certain things that
      Rather Unique AB will not take responsibility for.
      Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
      active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
      provided by your mobile network provider, but
      Rather Unique AB cannot take responsibility for the
      game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
      access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
      allowance left.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4"></p>
    <p class="my-4">
      If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
      should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
      mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
      may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
      for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
      or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
      accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
      roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
      territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
      roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
      which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
      that you have received permission from the bill payer for
      using the game.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      Along the same lines, Rather Unique AB cannot always
      take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
      need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
      runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
      Service, Rather Unique AB cannot accept
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      With respect to Rather Unique AB’s responsibility for
      your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
      important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
      ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
      rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
      we can make it available to you.
      Rather Unique AB accepts no liability for any loss,
      direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
      wholly on this functionality of the game.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
      currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
      both systems (and for any additional systems we
      decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
      and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
      playing the game. Rather Unique AB does not promise that
      it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
      and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
      installed on your device. However, you promise to always
      accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
      may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
      use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
      to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
      (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
      will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
      delete it from your device.
    </p>
